# Etude.js - Musical Memory Game

[Live Link](https://letsgitfunky.github.io/Maestro.js/)

## Background

    Welcome to Etude.js! In this Musical Memory Game, you will hear a series of notes played on the piano and repeat them back.
    Each round adds a new note to the end. Can you remember the whole melody?
    This game features an interactive piano interface created with JavaScript. You can play back the melody using either your mouse or the keyboard.

## Functionality & MVPs
In Etude.js, users will be able to:

-   Interact with a virtual piano keyboard
-   See notes that light up when played by computer and player
-   Hear and repeat various melodies
-   Recognize pitches and get comfortable with piano keyboard layout

In addition, this project will include:

-    High Score tracker: Note Streak
-    Hidden Mode to test your ear
-    Reset button to restart game
